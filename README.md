# Crowdlist

Crowdlist is a tool for collaborative list creation. This repo holds the frontend
part of the tool. It builds upon a single page of which the main view presents a list
of multiple grocery lists:
- Fr端hst端ck (breakfast)
- Mittag (lunch)
- Abendessen (dinner)

Each grocery list is viewable by clicking on it, which then represents itself as a
list of grocery items. The list of items can be extended by users using the textfield 
on top and already added items can be upvoted by other users. A user is identified by
an id and each grocery item holds an array of votes of all different users so that
it remains even if the original creator of the item decides to downvote/remove the item
from its preferences. The live backend is realized by a mongo database and a graphql server that provides the 
tool with data from the database. 

## TODOs

Development goals are managed with a [jira board](https://crowdlist.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CROW/boards/1
).
